A drag and drop video player. Connect videos visually to determine the sequence.

# WHAT IT DOES
You can:
* drop videos in the placeholders from your desktop
* move the videos around by grabbing them and dropping them
* click individual video thumbnails to play/pause the video
* attach the right dot of a video to the left dot of another video to have them play sequencially
* start a video then, click "play sequence" button to play the thumbs in squence
* start a video then, click "play sequence fullscreen" to open up a bigger player where the videos will play in the same holder in sequence 
         * click on this to enter true fullscreen mode
         * "play sequence fullscreen" button turns into "close fullscreen" button
== for now, the user must start the first video by clicking on it, so the player knows where to where to start


# STILL TO DO
* have the player know what the first video is, without the user having to click on it
* more feedback/labels/directions on the UI  

# HOW IT WAS MADE
this was a mashup up of code from this mp3 player, modified to play video
